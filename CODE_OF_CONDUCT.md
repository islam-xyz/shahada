# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Shahada.org exists to serve humanity. Every person who visits our site may be at one of the most important moments of their life. This project must reflect the highest standards of Islamic character — honesty, kindness, patience, and respect.

## Expected Behavior

- **Be respectful.** Treat every contributor and community member with dignity, regardless of their background, faith, or experience level.
- **Be patient.** Not everyone is a developer. Explain kindly.
- **Be truthful.** All Islamic content must be accurate and sourced from the Quran and authentic Sunnah.
- **Be constructive.** Critique ideas, not people. If you disagree, offer a better solution.
- **Be inclusive.** This project welcomes contributors of all faiths and backgrounds. You do not need to be Muslim to help.

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, insults, or personal attacks
- Discriminatory language or behavior
- Sharing content that contradicts mainstream Islamic scholarship without scholarly basis
- Spam, self-promotion, or off-topic discussions
- Any behavior that would harm the mission of helping people embrace Islam

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions and comments that violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated violations will result in being permanently banned from contributing.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by emailing **islamliveapp@gmail.com**. All reports will be reviewed and handled confidentially.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with modifications specific to the mission of Shahada.org.

# Contributing to Shahada.org

Jazāk Allāhu Khayran (May Allah reward you with goodness) for wanting to help. Every contribution — no matter how small — helps someone, somewhere, take their first step into Islam.

## How You Can Help

### 1. Report a Problem (No coding required)

If you notice something wrong — a mistranslation, a broken page, a typo — [open an issue](https://github.com/islam-xyz/shahada/issues/new/choose). We will fix it.

### 2. Fix a Translation

This is the most impactful way to contribute. If you speak a language and notice an error:

1. Go to the language folder (e.g., `fr/` for French, `ar/` for Arabic)
2. Find the incorrect text in the HTML file
3. Submit a Pull Request with the correction

**Please only fix translations in languages you are fluent in.** Accuracy is critical — this content guides people to Islam.

### 3. Fix a Bug

If you are a developer and find a code issue:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `fix/description-of-fix`
3. Make your change
4. Test it locally (open the HTML files in a browser)
5. Submit a Pull Request

### 4. Suggest an Improvement

Have an idea to make the site better? [Open a feature request](https://github.com/islam-xyz/shahada/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).

## Rules for Contributing

1. **Be respectful.** This is a sacred project. All interactions must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

2. **Be accurate.** If you are fixing Islamic content, cite your source (Quran verse, Hadith reference, or scholarly opinion).

3. **Keep it simple.** Shahada.org is intentionally minimal. We do not add complexity unless it directly helps someone convert to Islam.

4. **One change per Pull Request.** Do not bundle unrelated fixes together. This makes review faster.

5. **Test your changes.** Open the HTML file in a browser before submitting. Make sure nothing is broken.

6. **No new dependencies.** This project uses zero external libraries. Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Keep it that way.

## What We Will NOT Accept

- Changes that add tracking, analytics, or data collection
- Content that contradicts mainstream Islamic scholarship (Quran and Sunnah)
- Additions that add complexity without clear benefit to new Muslims
- Contributions that violate the project license

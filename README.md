## Mission

Make it as simple as possible for anyone, anywhere in the world, to take their first step into Islam.

- **Audio pronunciation** — Listen to the Shahada recited correctly, word by word
- **40+ languages** — From Arabic to Zulu, with more being added by the community
- **Global counter** — See how many people have taken the Shahada (completely anonymous)
- **Next steps** — Guides on Ghusl (purification) and Salah (prayer) for new Muslims
- **Zero tracking** — No cookies, no analytics, no data collection. Your faith is between you and Allah.

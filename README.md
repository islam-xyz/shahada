- **Global counter** — See how many people have taken the Shahada (completely anonymous)
- **Next steps** — Guides on Ghusl (purification) and Salah (prayer) for new Muslims
- **Privacy-respecting** — Anonymous analytics for site improvement only. No personal data is collected or sold. Your faith is between you and Allah.

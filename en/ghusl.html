            <h1>Ghusl: The Ritual Bath</h1>
            <p class="lead">Ghusl (Arabic: غُسْل) is the full-body ritual purification in Islam. After saying the Shahada, taking Ghusl is the first act that purifies you as you begin your new life as a Muslim.</p>
        </header>

        <!-- What is Ghusl -->
        <section class="guide-section" aria-labelledby="what-heading">
            <h2 id="what-heading">What Is Ghusl?</h2>
            <p>Ghusl is the Islamic procedure for washing the entire body with water. It is an act of spiritual purification that makes a person ritually clean (<em>tahir</em>) and eligible to perform acts of worship such as prayer (salah) and reciting the Quran.</p>
            <p>The word "ghusl" comes from the Arabic root meaning "to wash." It is different from <em>wudu</em> (partial ablution for daily prayers) in that it involves washing the entire body.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- When is Ghusl required -->
        <section class="guide-section" aria-labelledby="when-heading">
            <h2 id="when-heading">When Is Ghusl Required?</h2>
            <p>Ghusl becomes obligatory in the following situations:</p>
            <ul class="guide-list">
                <li><strong>After accepting Islam</strong> — This is your first Ghusl as a new Muslim, purifying you for your new beginning.</li>
                <li><strong>After sexual intercourse</strong> — Even if there is no ejaculation.</li>
                <li><strong>After ejaculation</strong> — Whether during sleep (wet dream) or while awake.</li>
                <li><strong>After menstruation ends</strong> — For women, Ghusl is required after the menstrual period is complete.</li>
                <li><strong>After post-natal bleeding (Nifas) ends</strong> — For women, after the post-childbirth bleeding stops.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ghusl is also <strong>recommended</strong> (Sunnah) before Friday (Jumu'ah) prayer, before Eid prayers, and before entering the state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="guide-section" aria-labelledby="how-heading">
            <h2 id="how-heading">How to Perform Ghusl</h2>
            <p>The following method is based on the hadith of A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her), who described how the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) performed Ghusl after Janaba (sexual impurity).</p>
            
            <div class="hadith-box">
                <p class="hadith-text">A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing Ghusl from Janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed Wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs.</p>

            <ul class="guide-list">
                <li><strong>The minimum requirement</strong> for Ghusl to be valid is that water reaches every part of the body, including rinsing the mouth and nose. The steps above represent the complete Sunnah method, which is the most rewarded way.</li>
                <li><strong>Soap and shampoo</strong> are permissible to use during Ghusl, but they are not required. The key is that water reaches every part of the body.</li>
                <li><strong>After Ghusl</strong>, you are in a state of full ritual purity and may pray, read the Quran, and perform other acts of worship without needing a separate Wudu (unless you break your Wudu afterwards).</li>
                <li><strong>Take your time</strong> — as a new Muslim, it is perfectly normal to learn this gradually. The most important thing is sincerity and effort.</li>

                <p>Ghusl is required after: sexual intercourse, ejaculation (whether awake or during sleep), the end of menstruation, the end of post-natal bleeding, and upon accepting Islam. It is also recommended before Friday prayer and Eid prayers.</p>

                <summary>Do I need to face a specific direction during Ghusl?</summary>
                <p>No, there is no requirement to face the Qiblah (direction of Makkah) during Ghusl. You may perform it in any direction.</p>
            </details>
            
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Is it necessary to wash the hair completely or just wet it?</summary>
                <p>Water must reach the roots of the hair and the scalp. The Prophet (peace be upon him) would run his fingers through the roots of his hair and pour three handfuls of water over his head. For women with braided hair, they do not need to undo their braids if water can reach the roots of the hair.</p>

            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>Can Ghusl replace Wudu for prayer?</summary>
                <p>Yes. If you perform Ghusl with the intention of purification, it suffices for prayer and you do not need to perform a separate Wudu afterwards — as long as you have not broken your Wudu after completing the Ghusl.</p>

                <summary>Can I perform Ghusl in the shower?</summary>
                <p>Yes. You can perform Ghusl in the shower. Simply follow the steps in order — make your intention, say Bismillah, wash your hands, wash private parts, perform Wudu, pour water over your head three times while rubbing through your hair, then wash your right side, left side, and finally your feet.</p>
            </details>
            
            <details class="faq-item">
                <summary>What is the difference between Ghusl and Wudu?</summary>
                <p>Wudu (partial ablution) is the washing of specific body parts — face, hands to elbows, wiping the head, and feet — done before each prayer. Ghusl (full ablution) is washing the entire body, required in specific circumstances such as after sexual impurity. Wudu is performed multiple times daily, while Ghusl is performed only when needed.</p>
